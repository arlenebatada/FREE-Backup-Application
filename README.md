# FREE-Backup-Application
FREE Backup Application is a console based application made in 'C'. Eventhough it has been made in 'C', a C++ compiler was used for convenience.

FREE Backup Application provides 2 methods for backup:

1. EXACTLY AS IN SOURCE:
It'll make Destination folder exactly like the Source folder. 
If any file is created/edited in the Source, it'll be copied to the destination.
If any file is deleted from the Source, it "WILL" be deleted from the destination as well.

2. BACKUP:
If any file is created/edited in the Source, it'll be copied to the destination.
If any file is deleted from the Source, it'll "NOT" be deleted from the destination

Source code is also made available. Anyone can view the source code and study it.
